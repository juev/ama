# Ask Me Anything (almost)

## First things first what the heck is this

Hello, I get a lot of the same questions pretty regularly. Here's a list of answers for you. If you have a question, make an issue for it. If I close said issue, don't be hurt, it means that either the question has been answered, or... I just don't want to answer it.

I'll answer most questions in those issues, but if they come up often enough, I'll add it to the FAQs below.
